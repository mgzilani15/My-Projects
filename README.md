# My-Projects
In this repository all my data science projects which is developed in Python or R will be found. Anybody can use the technique for study and research purposes only. In the list above there are some folders, which contains each project including the data, code and instruction.

Bellow you can find the summary of all the projects:

### Project of Ausgrid Energy Company:
In this project, A machine learning model been developed using the logistic regression. The data been taken from the company (Ausgrid energy) website, which is: http://www.ausgrid.com.au/Common/About-us/Corporate-information/Data-to-share/Solar-home-electricity-data.aspx#.Wa35zLIjHIV. The data is mainly the billing information of their customer who been using the solar panel or not, however the data was free to use for any research purposes. We been using Three tables:

          •	Solar customer information
          •	Non solar customer information 
          •	Customer location

Our aim was to find out the Machine learning model where we can suggest the customer, whether they can save money in their bill after using the solar panel or not. 

   #### Tools: 
          •	Jupyter notebook, which came with the anaconda distribution
          •	Python 3.0+ and the following Python libraries:
                                      	1. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ 
                                      	2. https://pandas.pydata.org/ 
                                      	3. https://matplotlib.org/ 
                                      	4. http://www.numpy.org/ 
                                      	5. https://seaborn.pydata.org/ 



### Domestic violence in NSW :
This project was developed in R.  The main of this project is to analyse the social data from a data scientist point of view, and highlight the findings about some facts. 

The data was used in this project was collected from the NSW census data about the domestic violence. Using these data our aim was finding the facts and trends of Domestic violence happening in NSW.  There are four data files been used to understand this situation, which are noted bellow:

          •	Data of Domestic violence
          •	Area or  Local Government Area
          •	Lebel of the data
          •	Summary statistics of the data

Using these Data file we developed a RMD file which been trying to finding the situation why and how the domestic violence is trending in NSW. We developed a linear regression model with this data to explain the domestic violence in NSW. 

#### Tools: 
	R
	R Studio
