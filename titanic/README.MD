## Titanic Data set from Kaggle:
This is my first knowledge based machine learning project.  I made the machine learning model and used various algorithm to see the performance of the algorithm and see which algorithm is the best suitable for our project. 

#### Data: 
The data is originally located in Kaggle web site.
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

#### How to run this notebook:
          •	Upload the "titanic-ver1.ipynb" iPython 3 Notebook to Jupyter Notebook server that supports python 3.6.
          •	Download the tytanic dataset from this web site https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
          •	Upload the data file to Jupyter Server in the same folder where the iPython file was uploaded.
          •	The notebook should run fine.
          •	PS. the notebook was developed and tested in windows laptop with 16GB RAM.
          •	To installation of Jupyter Notebook, please go to https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html
