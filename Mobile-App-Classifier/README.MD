# Mobile App Classifier :
In this project the initiative has been taken to implement a machine learning algorithm, to classify the apps based on the description of the apps and some other data files. It has been examined four given CSV files where we tried to figure out the data pattern and tried to find out the best solution for classify the apps. From the training data.csv file where the apps description and some Colum of TF-IDF (Term Frequency- Invert Document Frequency), been tried to build the best classifier.

### Data:
training_data.csv: There are 20,104 rows; each row corresponds to an app. 
training_desc.csv: There are 20,104 rows; each row is for an app 
training_labels.csv: There are 20,104 rows; each row is for an app. 
test_data.csv: This is a subset of the original data set 

### Tools:
      •	Jupyter notebook, which came with the anaconda distribution
      •	Python 3.0+ and the following Python libraries:

          •	http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ 
          •	https://pandas.pydata.org/ 
          •	https://matplotlib.org/ 
          •	http://www.numpy.org/ 
          •	https://seaborn.pydata.org/ 


### Algorithm and Result:
W used the KNN algorithm for classifying app in the app market and The accuracy of the algorithm using random validation set was 55.24 %.

### How to run this notebook 
Due to restriction of the data size the all data file not been given in the repository, if someone been interested to get the data can email to us to get the data from the google drive. however the data file is extremly big. 

          • Upload the python notebook file to Jupyter Notebook server that supports python 3.6. 
          • PS. the notebook was developed and tested in windows laptop with 16GB RAM. 
          • To installation of Jupyter Notebook, please go to https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html
